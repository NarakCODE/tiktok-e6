                    TikTok is a worldwide community, which is a big part of

                    reply to comments, check out who your followers are, and
                    connect with them through live streams. Interacting with
                    your audience is not only fun, but itâ€™s also an
                    effective way to build an engaged fanbase.

                    Knowledge is power! By knowing your audience, you can

                    TikTok allows you to see who's been checking out your
                    profile, giving you an insight into who your audience
                    is, as well as introducing you to potential

                    However, while you can see who's viewed your profile,

                <h4 class="heading-4" data-translate="paragraph_612">
                    As you can see, one of the reasons TikTok is so popular
                    is the way it helps bring creators and their audience
                    closer together. Thereâ€™s no better way of engaging with
                    your audience than live streaming. Going live on TikTok
                    allows you to broadcast to your followers and interact
                    with them at the same time.

                <h4 class="heading-4" data-translate="paragraph_614">
                    To go live, tap the + icon at the bottom of the screen
                    and swipe left to the LIVE tab. Enter a title for your
                    live stream and tap Go Live to start broadcasting.
                    Starting a live stream is perfect for popular formats
                    like Q&A sessions, post-match huddles, or even topical
                    roundtable discussions where you collaborate with other
                    creators.
