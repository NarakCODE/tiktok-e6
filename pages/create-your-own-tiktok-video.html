                        TikTok gives you the option to add a 150-character
                        description and tag people before you hit post.
                        Including keywords and hashtags relevant to your video
                        can help people discover it through TikTok search. Once
                        you‚Äôve added a description, simply hit post to share
                        your TikTok with the world.

                            üîé Hashtags are a great way for people to find your
                            content. For example, using #wwe for your wrestling
                            video allows you to tap into the one billion views
                            for that hashtag. Include relevant hashtags relating
                            to your video to help it get discovered by more
                            people.

                        Choosing the right time to post on TikTok can make a big
                        difference to your video‚Äôs success. To get as many views
                        as possible, it pays to post when your viewers are most
                        active. Think about when most people have free time,
                        like early in the morning, at lunchtime, or in the
                        evening.

                        Once you‚Äôve posted a couple of videos, you can see
                        exactly when your audience are on TikTok most often.
                        Simply go to your profile, hit the 3-line icon, and head
                        to Creator tools. Hit Analytics and select the Followers
                        tab to see when you should post to reach your followers.
