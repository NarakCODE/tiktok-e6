                        Ever find yourself swiping through videos for longer
                        than you’d like to admit? That’s what TikTok wants. To
                        keep you on the platform, its clever algorithm learns
                        the content you like watching most and delivers it to
                        you. So when you open up TikTok, you're instantly
                        greeted with a For You page full of videos you’ll want
                        to swipe through.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">
                        That’s only half the picture though. TikTok has
                        empowered millions of creators with its simple range of
                        features that make it easier than ever to create
                        attention-grabbing content. With its vast library of
                        music and sounds, filters and effects, anyone can pick
                        up TikTok and make something unique. You don’t need
                        expensive equipment or technical know-how to get
                        started, simply use your phone.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">
                        What’s more, TikTok has made collaborating with other
                        TikTokers possible in just a couple of taps. Its Duet
                        and Stitch features are simple to use - we'll show you
                        how further below - and mean you can have The Rock or
                        Gordon Ramsay starring in your videos.
                    </h4>

                    <h3 class="heading-3">How long are TikTok videos?</h3>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">
                        TikTok videos can be as short as a second or go all the
                        way up to 10 minutes. How long you want to make your
                        videos depends on the content itself. A quick kitchen
                        hack might only need a few seconds to explain, whereas a
                        full recipe could take a few minutes. What’s more
                        important than aiming for a particular length is making
                        sure your video hooks people all the way through.
