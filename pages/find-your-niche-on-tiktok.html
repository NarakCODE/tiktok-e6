                        Now you’ve created your TikTok account and made it your
                        own, it’s time to start creating content. In the crowded
                        world of TikTok, finding a niche can help you stand out.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="heading-4">
                        The beauty of TikTok is no matter how obscure your niche
                        is, the algorithm will still help you find the right
                        audience. You could probably guess #guitartok would be
                        popular, with over 11 billion views on videos of people
                        showing off their strumming skills. But even something
                        as unexpected as #welding has gained over 11 billion
                        views too!

                        yours. But if you’re stuck for ideas on where to start,
                        here’s some top pointers for finding your TikTok niche.

                        Making TikToks is more fun if you enjoy what you’re
                        doing. Try incorporating your favorite pastimes into
                        your content and create authentic videos people will
                        enjoy. So dust off your dancing shoes, warm up your
                        singing vocals, and start filming something you love.
